# Word Fall - A Game of Words

Rewrite of the [previous version](https://github.com/eigom/WordFall-Swift) of the game using cleaner architecture, SOLID principles, design patterns and functional programming.

This is work in progress.

## Design/Goals

- The code uses concepts from functional programming (avoid mutable state, use Try-construct like in Scala instead of exception handling etc)
- There are no third party dependencies
- Implementations can be changed or replaced without affecting core parts of the app
- Core modules are platform agnostic (can run on iOS, macOS etc)
- Testability

## ToDo

- Implement UI (SwiftUI, Combine)
- Compose iOS app from the components + MacOS app in the future
- Add tests
